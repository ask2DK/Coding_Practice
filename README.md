# **💻️Coding Practice💻️**

### ✒️ STUDY Rule :

```
# 하루에 한문제 이상 알고리즘 풀기
# 1시간 이내 풀지 못하면, solution 확인 및 리뷰 작성하기(solutions 비교하기)
# study AM08:00~AM09:00
```

<div markdown="1">
<br/></br>
   
STUDY 방식 :
- meeting and Study Together : AM 10:00 ~   
- Use the Neetcode, [https://neetcode.io/practice]   
- 요일별 모더레이터가 문제 풀이 후, 다른 팀원들과 리뷰 공유
<br/></br>
